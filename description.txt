Yee-Haw!

This is an open source 1.4.4 mod that adds many random things, none of which are even cowboy related at all...

Here's what's new:
New armor set and gear made from the new Neptunium Ore, found uncommonly underground!
New Town NPC and special currencies! (Get a Platinum Coin to unlock him!)
	- The first new currency, Trade Tokens, can be crafted from Gold Coins and Evil Bars!
	- The second new currency, Super Trade Tokens, can be crafted from Trade Tokens and Hallowed Bars!
Triangular Slimes, which spawn on the Surface, are an easier way to get Pink Gel!
An assortment of fun weapons and doohickeys!
	- Make money quickly with the Sword of Profit and its unique value-increasing mechanics!
	- Listen to a quirky tune with the IED explosive!
	- Knock enemies back even further with the Extendo Hand and Motorpuncher weapons!
	- Cycle through moon phases and moon styles with the Lunar Manipulator!
	- And more!
Probably some more stuff I don't remember :|

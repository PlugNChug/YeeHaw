CHANGELOG

v0.3.4 "Polishing"

- Added the Super Extendo Hand
	- It's an upgrade to the Extendo Hand that makes all entities and bosses extremely susceptible to knockback
	- Made with an Extendo Hand and Broken Hero Sword at a Mythril or equivalent anvil
- Sword of Profit rework
	- First of all it was bugged; striking an enemy multiple times resulted in exponential value growth with no limit
		- This resulted in regular enemies giving huge amounts of platinum coins
	- Made it so that exponential enemy value growth still happens, but it's more random
	- Unique popup text mechanics
	- Resprite
- Royal Bow rework
	- Because global autofire is an option in Terraria's settings, the Royal Bow's mechanics will be changed a bit
	- Now shoots two arrows for the cost of one, and is still autofireable
	- Resprite
- IED Changes
	- Now properly damages both players and enemies
	- Sound is now tied to the projectile
- Triangular Slime Changes
	- Triangular Slime no longer spawns during night
	- Added a fully functional banner (should also fix an issue with Green Slime Banner drops breaking)
	- Properly transforms into Shimmer Slime when Shimmered
- Supplier Changes
	- Shimmer sprites added
	- Shop rebalancing and Additions
		- Offers the Bloody Tear during a Hardmode Blood Moon for 3 Trade Tokens
		- OFfers Biome Mimic keys for 10 Trade Tokens each
		- Offers Souls of ____, based on which mech bosses you've defeated, for 1 Super Trade Token each
		- Offers the Solar Tablet for 5 Super Trade Tokens
		- Post ML weapons can now only be obtained post ML instead of post Cultist. Super Trade Token prices for these items were reduced to compensate.
		- Most items requiring normal Trade Tokens had prices reduced
- Renamed some Neptunium Weapons
	- Neptunium Sword -> Neptunium Longblade (This is to fix a naming bug that occurred starting in v0.3.3)
	- Neptunium Yoyo  -> Sleek Spinner
- Adjusted Neptunium Ore generation
- Adjusted tooltips for some items
- Adjusted max stacks for some items
- Improved the description/changelog
- Removed the /timeset command, I only used it for personal testing purposes. It was added in v0.3.0.
- Other small changes


v0.3.3.2

- Supplier NPC Changes
	- Spawn condition adjusted and fixed (used to be 5 platinum coins, but this condition didn't even work for some reason)
	- Happiness quotes improved
	- No longer likes the Mushroom Biome
	- Compatibility with Census Mod

v0.3.3.1

- Icon update :)

v0.3.3 "Porting"

- Now compatible with the current tModLoader build
- Adjusted some recipes
- Adjusted Supplier shop

v0.3.2 "What?"

I actually don't remember what I changed here but apparently this is the version the Steam Workshop has

v0.3.1 "The Supplier"

- New NPC: The Supplier
	Hopefully he can be polished as time goes on. Illegal and sketchy offers are in his shop. 
	Create Trade Tokens out of Silver Coins and Demonite/Crimtane Bars at an Anvil to trade with him. 
	You can upgrade Trade Tokens to Super Trade Tokens with Hallowed Bars and a Mythril Anvil.
- Also updated the icon

v0.3.0 "Content"

Additions:
- Neptunium Armor
	- Helmet - 10 Neptunium rods + Molten Helmet
	- Breastplate - 15 Neptunium rods + Molten Breastplate
	- Greaves - 12 Neptunium rods + Molten Greaves
	Wearing any of the pieces without wearing all three at the same time will inflict the Radiated debuff (the same debuff that's inflicted when holding Neptunium tools)
	The set bonus grants immunity to the Radiated debuff.
- Neptunium Arrow (100 Arrows + 1 Neptunium rod) and the "Silver Spinner" Yoyo (Wooden Yoyo + 9 rods) - Both can inflict the Radiated debuff on a target
- Extendo Hand - Slap Hand + Extendo Grip, it's like the Slap Hand but bigger
- Motorpuncher - Chlorophyte Jackhammer + Mechanical Glove, it's like the Slap Hand but operates like a Jackhammer
- Lunar Manipulator - 20 of every Lunar Event fragment + 10 Luminite Bar + 1 Ancient Manipulator. Left click to cycle moon phases, right click to cycle moon styles.
- /timeset command, a simple test command that allows you to set the time to dawn/noon/dusk/midnight outside of Journey mode
- Adjusted Terra Toilet Pickaxe and Royal Bow's sprites
- Slightly nerfed Neptunium Longblade's damage, buffed its knockback
- Significantly buffed the Sword of Profit's money drop increase, significantly reduced damage
- Fixed some price values on some items


v0.2.0 "Neptunium"

- Neptunium has been added to this mod.
	- Neptunium Ore - Generates Underground
	- Neptunium Rod - 4 ore at a Hellforge = this
	- Neptunium Pickaxe - Molten Pick + 12 rods, faster than Molten and +2 range, at the cost of lowering your defense when holding this. Struck enemies will have their defense lowered.
	- Neptunium Hamaxe - Molten Hamaxe + 10 rods, same thing as above.
	- Neptunium Longblade - Fiery Greatsword + 12 rods + 1 Ruby, struck enemies will have their defense lowered, but your defense will again be lowered when holding this.
	- The IED now takes one Neptunium Rod to craft in addition to its previous recipe.
- Adjusted some other stuff for existing items.


v0.1.0 "Initial Release"

Initial Additions
- Sword of Profit - Applies the Midas debuff on contact (enemies drop more coins on death)
- Royal Bow - Autoshooting post-EOC bow
- Terra Toilet Pickaxe - Exactly what you think it is
- IED - Plays the Arabic Nokia tune before exploding a huge radius (nerfed from the 1.3 version, explosion is much smaller)
- Wooden Gun - Uses Wooden Bullets, craftable immediately after starting a new world.
- Triangular Slime - A slime variant found in the overworld.
